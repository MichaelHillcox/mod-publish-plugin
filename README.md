Basic example to publish a jar to CurseForge, Modrinth and Github from a Fabric project:
```gradle
publishMods {
    file = remapJar.archiveFile
    changelog = "Hello!"
    type = STABLE
    modLoaders.add("fabric")

    curseforge {
        projectId = "123456"
        accessToken = providers.environmentVariable("CURSEFORGE_TOKEN")
        minecraftVersions.add("1.20.1")

        requires {
            slug = "fabric-api"
        }
    }
    modrinth {
        projectId = "abcdef"
        accessToken = providers.environmentVariable("MODRINTH_TOKEN")
        minecraftVersions.add("1.20.1")
    }
    github {
        repository = "test/example"
        accessToken = providers.environmentVariable("GITHUB_TOKEN")
        commitish = "main"
    }
}
```

Run the `publishMods` task to publish to all configured destinations.
