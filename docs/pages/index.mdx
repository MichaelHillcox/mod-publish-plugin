### FAQ
- Why use Kotlin?
  - I wanted to explore using Kotlin for a larger project, as Gradle already includes Kotlin there should be little downside to the end user.
- Why do I need to specify the minecraft versions for both CurseForge and Modrinth?
  - Curseforge and Modrinth use different versioning for snapshots, thus they must be defined for each platform.
- Feature x or platform y is not supported
